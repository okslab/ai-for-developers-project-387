# Integration tests (E2E)

Playwright end-to-end tests that drive the real frontend against the real
backend in a browser. They cover the core booking journey end to end.

Scenarios are described in [`SCENARIOS.md`](./SCENARIOS.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20 and npm.
- Python 3.12+ with the backend dependencies installed (see
  [`../backend/README.md`](../backend/README.md)).

## Install

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Run

`npm test` starts the backend and frontend automatically (via Playwright
`webServer`) and runs the tests headless:

```bash
npm test
```

Useful flags:

```bash
npm test -- --headed        # watch the browser
npm test -- --grep "guest"  # run only the guest scenarios
```

## Configuration

- Backend API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (override with `E2E_API_URL` /
  `E2E_API_PORT`).
- Frontend: `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (override with `E2E_WEB_PORT`).
- The frontend is pointed at the backend via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, set by the
  Playwright `webServer` entry, so no `.env` is needed.

In CI the frontend and backend are started by Playwright inside the same job
(see `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).
